# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
- **Single Page Application (SPA)**: Built with vanilla JavaScript and HTML, using client-side routing to navigate between Home, About, Portfolio, and Login sections
- **Styling Framework**: PicoCSS for clean, minimal design with custom CSS animations including gradient backgrounds and GSAP animations
- **Interactive Elements**: Font Awesome icons and PIXI.js for enhanced visual effects
- **Authentication State**: Client-side token management for admin login sessions

## Backend Architecture
- **Express.js Server**: RESTful API endpoints for portfolio management, file uploads, authentication, and subscriber management
- **File Storage**: Local filesystem storage with organized directory structure (`uploads/about/`, `uploads/portfolio/`, `uploads/shop/`)
- **Authentication**: Simple token-based authentication with hardcoded admin credentials (`Martin3z` / `May2nd1989`)
- **File Upload Handling**: Multer middleware for processing multipart form data and file uploads with automatic filename generation

## Data Storage
- **Replit Database**: Primary storage for subscriber information and persistent data
- **JSON Files**: Local JSON files for storing portfolio items and about section data (`about.json`, `portfolio.json`)
- **File System**: Direct file storage for uploaded images with timestamp-based naming

## Email System
- **Nodemailer Integration**: SMTP-based email service for sending notifications to subscribers
- **Automatic Notifications**: Triggered when new portfolio items are uploaded, keeping subscribers engaged with fresh content
